              <p>
                Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed
                in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
                languages such as JavaScript.

              <h3>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)<i class="fas fa-angle-down" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>
              <p>
                CSS is a style language applied to define the look and format of a document written in a markup language
                such as HTML.

              <h3>Responsive Web Design (RWD)<i class="fas fa-angle-down" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>
              <p>
                Responsive web design (RWD) is an approach to web design that makes web pages render well on a variety
                of devices and windows or screen sizes. Recent work also considers the viewer proximity as part of the
                viewing context as an extension for RWD. Content, design, and performance are necessary across all

              <h3>Content Management Systems (CMS)<i class="fas fa-angle-down" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>
              <p>
                A content management system (CMS) is a software application that can be used to manage the creation and
                modification of digital content. CMSs are typically used for enterprise content management (ECM) and web
                content management (WCM). ECM typically supports multiple users in a collaborative environment by
                integrating document management, digital asset management, and record retention. Alternatively, WCM is
                the
                collaborative authoring for websites and may include text and embed graphics, photos, video, audio, maps
                and program code that display content and interact with the user. ECM typically includes a WCM function.

                JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web
                pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side
                page behavior, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it. You will
                also gain experience working with libraries like jQuery and React.
